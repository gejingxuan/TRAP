# TRAP
TRAP, an advanced deep learning framework enhanced by contrastive learning, 
which enriches the feature space beyond sequence level by incorporating structural details of pMHC, 
elucidating subtle conformational influences on binding.

# Usage
## 1. Environment
Hereï¼Œyou can construct the conda environment for TRAP from the yaml file:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
## 2. Input Data Generation
For the sake of computational efficiency, we will first generate the corresponding feature input file.
For pMHC structures in PDB format, we use `prepare.py` to extract structures from the path of AlphaFold Multimer results,
and we use `pmhc_gen.py` to extract features and generate the input data for TRAP.

```
python -u pmhc_gen.py --struc_path [your_structure_path] --epi_max [the max length of epitope] --file_path [your_pmhc_feature_file_path]
```

For TCR (cdr3 beta) sequence, we use `cdr_gen.py` to extract features and generate the input data for TRAP.

```
python -u cdr_gen.py --data_dir [your_cdr_sequence_path] --b_max [the max length of cdr3 beta] --cdr_dir [your_cdr_feature_file_path]
```
## 3. Training and Prediction
Then we use the input data generated in the last step to train and test model.

```
python -u train.py --data_dir [your_datasets_dir] --cdr_dir [your_cdr_feature_file_path] --epi_dir [your_pmhc_feature_file_path]
```
